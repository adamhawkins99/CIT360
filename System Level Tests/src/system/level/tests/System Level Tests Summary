System testing of software or hardware is testing conducted on a complete, 
integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements. 
System testing falls within the scope of black-box testing, and as such, 
should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic. 
System testing is performed on the entire system in the context of a 
Functional Requirement Specification(s) (FRS) and/or a System Requirement Specification (SRS). 
System testing tests not only the design, but also the behavior 
and even the believed expectations of the customer.

Purpose:
Check that configuration and code is functional
Ensure that the system’s initial build meets the agreed requirements
Help to control the project scope
Confirm that the finished system can support the client’s business
processes
Gain client’s approval to release new functionality for general use
