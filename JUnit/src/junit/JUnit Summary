JUnit is a very popular and vary handy testing framework.

It provides a great framework to apply tests of your code as part of your code.  

You can setup the framework to run Junit unit tests as a part of the build process.  

You can then write in functional tests as part of the code.  

I had to import Junit.org in order to get it to work.  

It works to implement TDD or test driven development. 

For JUnit you need both the code and the test code to work. For mine I used the Junit.java 
then JUnitTest.java.

In mine I used the:
//assertFalse and assertTrue
//assertNotNull and assertNull
//assertSame and assertNotSame
//assertArrayEquals
to test some very basic math values.
