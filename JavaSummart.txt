These interfaces are uses in Java API to collect and store different date for the programmer to use.  

Each one has different characteristics and can be used for different scenarios.

List: The list interfaces takes a collection and then declares different behaviors and sequence.
It can be based on position and may contain duplicates.  
It can have lead to unsupported operation if you don't allow midication and class cast issues if the objects
are incompatible. 

SET: Set is a collection but can't have duplicates.  The set feature combined with a tree interface
is great for taking data and sorting it.  

Map: The map Gives unique keys to values.  For example the one I used was to assign a different program 
atribute to a particular week.  The map interface allows you to retrieve the information later using the
keys.  So if I wanted to write a program that gives the assigned topic for each week I could use that key.

Queue: The queue interface is for holding elements prior to processing.  Queue is usually first in first out.
It can use the following: 
Queue Interface Structure
Type of Operation	Throws exception	Returns special value
Insert	add(e)	offer(e)
Remove	remove()	poll()
Examine	element()	peek()

Tree: The tree set was one of my favorite to learn.  It is used in conjunction with set interface for storage.
It creates a faster access and retrievel of the information which is best for large amounts of data.
