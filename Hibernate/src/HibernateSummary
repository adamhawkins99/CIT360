Hibernate is awesome, but it was also one of the more challenging ones for me.  Hibernate handles the mapping
between Java classes and database tables.  I am taking a database class right not so this was 
really interesting for me.  It was really neat to see how Java works with Microsoft 
SQL and other databases.  
Hibernate also work with data query and retrieval facilities.  

In the example I use it takes some very basic student information stored in
a database and puts it into a simple string form.  
The configuration was a beast to get setup but I finally got it working.  

This has been one of the tougher ones for me but also rewarding as well.
