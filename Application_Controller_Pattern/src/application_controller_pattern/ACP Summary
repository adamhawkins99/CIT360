The Application Controller Pattern or ACP can be used to centralize retrieval and invocation of request-processing components.
It is a sub pattern that is used within applications to manage various views.  
The advantage is that it allows you to use and reuse the code to manage the views 
and should also make it easier to handle extensibility across the application. 

In the example I used my controller to create a gun list array with the ability to 
add to and take remove guns.  
In the controller portion I used the HashMap feature to control the handler. 

I struggled with this one at first but once I started to see it comet together
it all made sense.  I can see the value of using this feature.
