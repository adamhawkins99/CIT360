JSON stands for Java Script Object Notation

It is a syntax for storing and exchanging data

JSON is really handy since you can store, exchange and send Data in JavaScript

In the example I used you can gather information from an end user on the classes
that they still need to take at BYU-I and the desired grade that they hope to 
achieve.  You can then print it out to a separate file or store the data in the array.
The outcome of the program would look something like this based on the users input:



run:
Please Enter Your Name: Adam Hawkins
Please Enter the Course/Courses you still need to take at BYU-I:
If no other course/s, leave it blank, and hit enter. cit225
Enter Percent Grade You Hope to Achieve (example 83): 99
Please Enter the Course/Courses you still need to take at BYU-I:
If no other course/s, leave it blank, and hit enter. cit360
Enter Percent Grade You Hope to Achieve (example 83): 88
Please Enter the Course/Courses you still need to take at BYU-I:
If no other course/s, leave it blank, and hit enter. cit410
Enter Percent Grade You Hope to Achieve (example 83): 89
Please Enter the Course/Courses you still need to take at BYU-I:
If no other course/s, leave it blank, and hit enter.
