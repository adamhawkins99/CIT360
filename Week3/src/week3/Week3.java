     *Threading is a huge part of Java.  It allows or multiple operations to run both synchronous and Asynchronous
     *It does this in two ways, either a Thread class or Runnable interface.  In the examples this week I show both then also show
     *an executor example.  The executor is an interface for launching a new task.  You then need handlers to schedule runnables.  
     *I also used a Try and Catch block in order to handle any exceptions.  
     *Thanks Brother Tuckett, I am starting to begin to understand how this all comes together.
