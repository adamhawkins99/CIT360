HTTP/URL is used to incorporate simple requests using HTTP protocol.  

It is called up using the URL.OpenConnection() then casts the result to HttpUrlConnection.

It is fairly simple to do but you have to add in come catches in order to handle exceptions and wrong URL

This can be using the catch (IOException e) method and then displaying the error message.

Failry straight forward but a great addition to understand.
