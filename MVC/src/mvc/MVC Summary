MVC Stand for Model View Controller

It separates the calculations and data from the interface.  
The Model is the class that contains the data and the methods needed to use the data. 
The View is the interface. 
The Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View.

In the Example I used, the controller would coordinate the data entered into the view interface and stored 
in the model side.  The result would be to take the Students information would be 
taken and then end up in a basic format

 System.out.println("Student: ");
      System.out.println("Name: " + name);
      System.out.println("Studnet ID: " + studID);

Student: Adan Hawkins Student ID: 1234567
